# Snake for Square Space

No muss, no fuss, just load index.html and click start!
Stopped at the 3 hour mark as requested with only cleanup left:
1.  More debugging - didn't really have time to proofread the whole thing carefully and really debug it
2.  Commenting - I love commenting all my code but I didn't want to spend another 30 minutes commenting every line.
        Things like the object assignment I used in the controller.  I know that is not a deep copy but it does what I needed and time was a factor.
